<h1>Instructions for candidate boxes</h1>
A "candidate" bounding box is a bounding box generated by running a trained model on a streetview panorama.  The trained model "thinks" the bounding box contains an invasive species.  The trained model will get better over time by having a human review these candidate boxes and confirm the presence of an invasive species in the bounding box, or reject (no invasive species present).


<ul>
  <li>Click the "Get 5 random candidates" to get 5 random candidate boxes</li>
  <li>Inspect each candidate image and its label, if the image contains the invasive species, click the "Confirm" button, otherwise click the "Reject" button.  If you are unsure (image is too blurry, or just can't tell), click the "unsure" button.
  <li>The "View Panorama" link just below the image will allow you to view the candidate box as part of the whole panorama.  The additional context may help determine if the candidate box contains or does not contain an invasive plant species</li>
  <li>Once you've processed all 5 panoramas (by clicking either confirm/reject/unsure), you can click the "Get 5 random candidates" to get another set of candidate boxes</li>
</ul>
